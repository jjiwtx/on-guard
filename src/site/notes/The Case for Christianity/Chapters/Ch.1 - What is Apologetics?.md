# How to Get the Most Out of This Book
Dr. Craig states in this section, "This book is intended to be a sort of training manual to equip you to fulfill the command of 1 Peter 3:15 (...but in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, ready at any time to give a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you). So this is a book to be *studied*, not just read.
