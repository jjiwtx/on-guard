# Introduction

Welcome to the course, **The Case for Christianity: Strengthening Faith with Reason, Logic, and Fact**. In this course, we'll be walking through the book, [*On Guard: Defending Your Faith with Reason and Precision* by William Lane Craig](https://www.amazon.com/Guard-Defending-Faith-Reason-Precision/dp/1434764885/), which is available as a paperback book or a Kindle book (ebook). If you would like, you can also purchase the study guide - [On Guard Study Guide by William Lane Craig and Dennis W. Fuller](https://www.amazon.com/Guard-Study-Guide-William-Craig/dp/1452889589/), which is available as a paperback. 

# Format of the Course
Each week, we'll be discussing the contents of the ten chapters of *On Guard*. It is not my intent to *cover* each chapter, but rather to *uncover* each chapter. Although I will do some "presenting" of the content, the focus of each session is to give you, in conjunction with your fellow learners, to explore, discuss, clarify, and ask questions related to the content. Therefore, one type of activity we will engage is is called "think-pair-share" in which I will pose a question, or offer to you a choice of questions. We'll divide up into groups of two or three. You'll think about it
