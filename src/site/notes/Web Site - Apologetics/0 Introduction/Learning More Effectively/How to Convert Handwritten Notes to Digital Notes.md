### Reasons for converting analog notes to digital notes

If the note you've written is important, you don't want to lose it. So you should convert the note into a digital note and store it on your computer and/or in the cloud (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.). Also, by converting the notes to digital notes, you'll be able to search for terms in your notes.

### Analog to Image

Some methods described below simply take a photo of your hand-written note and convert them to a photo (jpg) or a PDF file. If you want to be able to search the text of your notes, you'll need a method that converts your notes into digital text. (See the next section, Analog to Text.)

### Analog to Text

If you want to be able to search your notes for specific words or phrases, you need to convert your hand-written notes to text. The ability of a method to do this is called Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

#### Use an iPad App

Some iPad apps let you take notes within the app using a stylus (e.g., Apple Pen) and then they'll convert your handwritten notes to text. Here's a list of apps that do that:
