## Introduction
God has revealed Himself to humanity through two distinct ways: general revelation and special revelation. 

## General Revelation
General revelation refers to the ways God has revealed himself and his attributes to all people through nature and the universe. This type of revelation is referred to as "general" because it has been revealed to everyone, everywhere, and at all times. 

The natural world and its beauty, complexity, and order point to a powerful Creator. [Psalms 19:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms%2019%3A1-4&version=NLT&interface=print) [^Psalms-19:1-4] and [Romans 1:20](https://www.bibleref.com/Romans/1/Romans-1-20.html) highlight how the heavens and the earth declare God's glory and divine nature. 

The study of God and his attributes based on observation of nature is called **natural theology**. 

While general revelation can demonstrate God's existence and some of his attributes, it does not convey God's plan of salvation for mankind. 
## Special Revelation
Special revelation refers to how God has revealed himself through the Bible and Jesus Christ.
