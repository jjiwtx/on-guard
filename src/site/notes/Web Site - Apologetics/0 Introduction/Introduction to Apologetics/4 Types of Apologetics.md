Two types of apologetics are **positive apologetics** and **negative apologetics**. Positive apologetics involves providing justifications for why the claims of Christianity are true. On the other hand, negative apologetics involves answering objections to the claims of Christianity. 

Apologetics could also be divided into **devotional apologetics** and **evangelistic apologetics**. Devotional apologetics is geared toward Christians and helping them gain an understanding confidence in the claims of Christianity. Evangelistic apologetics is apologetics that is geared toward those who are not Christians. 

Combining these four types provides us with four types of apologetics and purposes. 

**Negative evangelistic apologetics** consists of providing answers to the questions and objections non-Christians might have. This type of apologetics provides reasons for non-Christians not to believe in the claims of Christianity. As such, negative apologetics could involve using logic to point out inconsistencies and flawed logic in the arguments being presented. It can also involve examining opposing worldviews and demonstrating logical inconsistencies and flaws in them. Negative evangelistic apologetics works alongside positive evangelistic apologetics, which provides affirmative cases for accepting Christianity, not just defending objections to it. To be effective in negative evangelistic apologetics, knowledge, thoughtfulness, and respect are needed. Remember, the purpose of apologetics is not to “win an argument” but to provide reasons for believing the claims of Christianity. 

**Positive evangelistic apologetics** involves providing an affirmative compelling case for the truth of Christianity. Its primary purpose is to show that Christianity is both rational and meaningful, and to give non-Christians a reason to believe and accept the gospel. Positive evangelistic apologetics provides reasons and evidence for believing in such things as the existence of God, the resurrection of Jesus, and the reliability of the Bible. Not only does positive evangelistic apologetics provide reasons to accept the claims of Christianity, but can also show that Christianity has answers to questions about suffering, morality, and the meaning and purpose of life.

**Negative devotional apologetics** helps Christians to be confident in their faith when they consider questions and doubts raised either by themselves or others. Questions and challenges might be intellectual, scientific, emotional, or cultural. By providing answers, negative devotional apologetics strengthens the Christians faith and trust in the truths of Christianity. If another Christian has questions or doubts, listen empathetically, listen without judgement, and provide them with a safe place to ask questions. Provide thoughtful, rational reasoning with scriptural support. If you have had questions yourself, share that with them. Encourage them to continue exploring and explain that doubts and questions can be a natural part of the Christian faith. Provide resources, possibly in the form of books, articles, videos, and people who have dealt with their same questions. Walk alongside them in their exploration. 

**Positive devotional apologetics** aims to build up, encourage, and strengthen the faith and confidence of the Christian in the truths of Christianity. By doing so, the Christian can realize that Christianity can address both questions of the mind and the heart. Positive devotional apologetics can bolster the Christian’s faith and trust in God, and help them grow in assurance and spiritual maturity. By learning about why Christianity is true, the Christian can gain a deeper love and commitment to God and the principles of the Bible. When encountering difficult times, knowing and believing in the truths of Christianity, the Christian can be comforted and increase their resilience. The Christian can strengthen their faith and trust in God by learning principles of the Bible, using logic and reason to support those principles and teachings, and apply those principles in their life. By approaching learning with an attitude of humility, and intellectual exploration, the Christian will increase their confidence, assurance, faith, trust and devotion to God and the Bible.
